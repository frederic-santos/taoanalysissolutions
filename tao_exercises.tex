\section{The natural numbers}
\label{sec:natural-numbers}
\begin{exo}{2.2.1}{Prove that the addition is associative, i.e. that
    for any natural numbers $a, b, c$, we have $(a+b) + c = a + (b+c)$.}

  Let's use induction on $c$ while keeping $a$ and $b$ fixed.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Base case for $c=0$: let's prove that $(a+b)+0 = a+(b+0)$. The
    left hand side is equal to $(a+b)$ according to Lemma 2.2.3. For the
    right hand side, if we apply the same lemma to the $(b+0)$ part,
    we get $a + (b+0) = a+b$. Both sides are equal to $a+b$, and the
    base case is thus done.
  \item Now let's suppose inductively that $(a+b) + c = a + (b+c)$: we
    have to prove that $(a+b) + \successor{c} = a + (b +
    \successor{c})$. Using Lemma 2.2.3 on the right
    hand side leads to $a + \successor{(b+c)}$. Now consider the left
    hand side. Using still the same lemma, we get $(a+b) +
    \successor{c} = \successor{\left((a+b) + c\right)}$. By the
    inductive hypothesis, this is also equal to
    $\successor{\left(a + (b+c)\right)}$. And, using the lemma 2.2.3
    again, this also leads to $a + \successor{b+c}$. Therefore, both
    sides are equal to $a + \successor{b+c}$, and we have closed the
    induction.
  \end{itemize}
\end{exo}

\begin{exo}{2.2.2}{Let $a$ be a positive number. Prove that there
    exists exactly one natural number $b$ such that $\successor{b} =
    a$.}
  
  Let's use induction on $a$.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Base case for $a=1$: we know that $b=0$ matches this property,
    since $\successor{0} = 1$ by Definition 2.1.3. Furthermore, there
    is only one solution. Suppose that is another natural number $b$
    such that $\successor{b} = 1$. Then, we would have
    $\successor{b} = \successor{0}$, which would imply $b = 0$ by
    Axiom 2.4. The base case is demonstrated.
  \item Let's suppose inductively that there is exactly one natural
    number $b$ such as $\successor{b} = a$. We have to prove that
    there is exactly one natural number $b'$ such as
    $\successor{b'} = \successor{a}$. By the induction hypothesis, and
    taking $b' = \successor{b}$, we have
    $\successor{b'} = \successor{(\successor{b})} = \successor{a}$. So
    there exists a solution, with $b' = \successor{b} = a$. Uniqueness is
    given by Axiom 2.4.: if $\successor{b'} = \successor{a}$, then we
    necessarily have $b'=a$.
  \end{itemize}
