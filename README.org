I'll host on this repo my current work on Terence Tao's textbooks, [[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811017896][Analysis I]] & [[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811018046][II]].

As I'm self-studying for fun and in a rather casual way, this constitutes only /propositions/ of solutions, maybe incorrect, and surely inelegant. (In other words: using those solutions for your homework is likely a bad idea.)

Pull requests to fix typos or errors are welcome.

The LaTeX file makes use of the [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mbboard][mbboard]] package. It provides nicer math fonts, but is not part of most LaTeX distributions and must be installed manually.
