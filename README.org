#+TITLE: Solutions for /Analysis/ I and II by Terence Tao
#+AUTHOR: Frédéric Santos

I'll host on this repo my current work on Terence Tao's textbooks, [[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811017896][Analysis I]] & [[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811018046][II]].

Note that this constitutes only /propositions/ of solutions; errors are still possible. Pull requests to fix typos or errors are welcome.

* Notes
- The LaTeX file makes use of the [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mbboard][mbboard]] package. It provides nicer math fonts, but is not part of most LaTeX distributions and must be installed manually.
